	abstract = {Modern web applications, due to the functionalities they provide in their user interfaces, have a complex program structure. Manually writing a program code, due to the complexity of the entire application,
can result in uneven quality and content of individual application parts. Maintaining such developed applications is more difficult. Because of this, web applications are often developed by using different
frameworks. A framework allows structuring, simpler and more uniform program script writing, and thus easier web application maintenance.

There are various frameworks that can be used in the development of web applications, for different parts of the application. Those analyzed in this paper are used in the development of front end parts of web applications. According to their design, a web application can be developed as the Multi Page (MPA) or the Single Page (SPA).

This paper explains the difference between MPA and SPA web applications.
The advantages and disadvantages of MPA are demonstrated in relation to
SPA web applications. Required characteristics that the framework should have in order to be optimized for creating MPA and SPA web applications are set. The hypothesis has been tested: There is a framework that is optimized for the development of both MPA and SPA applications. Possibilities, architecture and development techniques of a web application using front end frameworks, as well as the suitability of such frameworks for the development of MPA
and SPA web applications have been analysed. Choosing a framework for the hypothesis testing has been performed based on the popularity of available frameworks. The required characteristics have been analyzed on the three most popular frameworks:
Angular, Vue.js and React-js. It has been shown that the Vue.js framework is the most optimized framework for the development of both MPA and SPA applications.
          , 
            Moderne web-aplikacije, zbog funkcionalnosti koje omogućuju u korisničkom sučelju, imaju složenu programsku strukturu. Ručno pisanje programskog koda zbog složenosti cijele aplikacije može rezultirati neujednačenom kvalitetom i sadržajem pojedinih aplikacijskih djelova. Održavanje tako razvijanih aplikacija otežano je. Zbog toga se web-aplikacije često razvijaju korištenjem različitih frameworka. Framework omogućuje strukturiranje, jednostavnije i ujednačenije pisanje
programskog koda, te time olakšava održavanje web-aplikacije. Postoji puno frameworka koji se mogu koristiti u razvoju web-aplikacija, i to za
različite dijelove aplikacije, a oni analizirani u ovom radu koriste se
u razvoju front end dijela web-aplikacije. Prema načinu izvođenja webaplikacije mogu biti Multi Page (MPA) ili Single Page (SPA). U radu je objašnjena različitost između MPA i SPA web-aplikacija. Pokazane su prednosti i nedostatci MPA u odnosu na SPA web-aplikacije. Postavljene su zahtijevane karakteristike frameworka koji je optimiziran za izradu MPA i SPA web-aplikacija. Testirana je hipoteza: Postoji framework koji je prilagođen za izradu i MPA i SPA aplikacija. Analizirane su mogućnosti, arhitektura i načini razvoja web-aplikacija pomoću front end
frameworka te prilagođenost takvih frameworka za razvoj MPA i SPA web-aplikacija. Izvršen je odabir frameworka za testiranje hipoteze prema popularnosti na tržištu. Zahtijevane karakteristike analizirane su
na 3 najpopularnija frameworka: Angular, Vue.js i React-js. Pokazano je
da je Vue.js framework najoptimiziraniji framework za izradu i MPA i SPA aplikacija.},

	abstract = {React.js and Next.js are among the JavaScript frameworks for building web applications. This thesis compares them in popularity, availability of documentation, and performance. Through a literature review in the theory part, the thesis will show the pros and cons of using each, thereby giving a starting point in decision making on choosing the proper framework based on the scale and intended purpose of the application. Furthermore, this thesis analyzes the popularity and availability of documentation of the frameworks. Data from GitHub, Stackoverflow, NPM trends, and Google trends were analyzed to see their popularity. The materials, manuals, and tutorials provided by the official React.js and Next.js websites provide adequate documentation for both frameworks. This paper comes with two similar applications made by React.js and Next.js for performance comparison. Lighthouse performance metrics from Google Chrome were used to measure the performance of each framework. In conclusion, React.js outperformed Next.js based on the comparison criteria. Despite React.js popularity and better performance, Next.js offers server-side rendering that makes fast initial loading possible and improves the user experience. Overall, developing large-scale applications and conducting extensive concurrent user load testing should be performed to reach a more sensible deduction.},

	abstract = {Identifying software requirements, designing, coding, and testing using frameworks and technologies are all part of the web application development process. Frameworks are collections of libraries and classes that provide a wide range of capabilities. For front-end and back-end development, there are a variety of frameworks that support multiple programming languages. Front-end development employs front-end programming languages to create what the user sees on a website; back-end development employs back-end programming languages to fulfill those requests on the server side. When used together, it produces a unified look and feel. The database is where the data for web applications is stored for usage by back-end frameworks. Choosing the proper combination of front-end and back-end frameworks is the most critical component of the web development lifecycle. This paper discusses frontend and back-end frameworks.

Este informe de proyecto de grado evalúa dos de los más destacados frameworks, React y Angular, mediante el desarrollo de una aplicación web que necesita mostrar gráficos de datos científicos. El estudio se centra en las cualidades más críticas para el desarrollo web: documentación, facilidad de uso, apoyo comunitario y modularidad. Para graficar datos científicos, la evaluación se basa en las entradas de los usuarios, específicamente de los investigadores, así como en la escalabilidad y funcionalidad que cada marco puede proporcionar. El estudio incluyó el desarrollo de una aplicación web utilizando ambos marcos, con el objetivo de crear la misma aplicación dos veces y luego evaluar el proceso de desarrollo.El objetivo era proporcionar a los estudiantes de ingeniería informática una comprensión más profunda del desarrollo y los desafíos asociados con el uso de dos de los marcos más destacados de la industria. Los resultados destacaron que React superó a Angular en varias áreas clave, particularmente en la facilidad de uso y el apoyo de la comunidad, con React logrando una puntuación promedio de 9.25 en comparación con Angularulars 6.25. La documentación de Reacts y el enfoque estructurado fueron más intuitivos y beneficiosos para los desarrolladores con experiencia a nivel universitario. Si bien ambos marcos requerían el uso de D3.js para las capacidades de gráficos, el proceso de integración de Reactatss fue más fluido y eficiente. Estos hallazgos tienen como objetivo guiar a los estudiantes en la elección del marco más adecuado para sus necesidades en el desarrollo de aplicaciones webenfatizando React como la opción más adecuada para aquellos que buscan un marco sencillo y bien respaldado.},

by showing the successful integration of several technologies, especially in the
context of healthcare applications. These include Kepler.gl for perceptive data
visualization, React and Redux for dynamic and responsive user interfaces, Keycloak
for strong user authentication, and TypeScript for improved code dependability and
maintainability. The complicated requirements of healthcare systems are addressed
by this well-thought-out integration, which focuses on enhancing user interfaces,
data handling, and security.
The project’s outcomes highlight the potential of modern web technologies to
significantly improve the efficiency, security, and user engagement of healthcare
applications. The integration of these technologies has led to a more maintainable
and error-resistant codebase, secure and efficient user authentication processes,
optimized state management, and enhanced data visualization capabilities that
support caregiver decision-making.
The produced prototype provides a flexible and clean practical framework
that forms the basis for future applications. It emphasizes how crucial complete
technology integration is to tackle the many issues that healthcare services must
deal with. The thesis ends with research directions that should be pursued, such
as investigating real-time data updates, improving state management strategies,
and developing interactive geospatial data visualization tools.
This summary encapsulates the essence of the thesis, emphasizing the innovative
integration of technologies and their practical applications in enhancing webbased healthcare services, and provides a clear pathway for future research and
development in this vital area.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen the rise of a new generation of UI frameworks for web application development. These frameworks differ from previous generations of JavaScript frameworks in that they define a declarative application development model, where transitions in the state of the UI are managed by the framework. This potentially greatly simplifies application development, but requires the framework to implement a rendering strategy which translates changes in application state into changes in the state of the UI. The performance characteristics of these rendering strategies have thus far been poorly studied.
In this article, we describe the rendering strategies used in the frameworks Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor, which represent some of the most influential and widely used modern web frameworks. We find significant differences in the scaling of costs in their rendering strategies with potentially equally significant practical performance implications. To verify these differences, we implement a number of benchmarks that measure the scaling of rendering costs as an application grows in complexity.
The results of our benchmarks confirm that under certain circumstances, performance differences between frameworks can range up to several orders of magnitude when performing the same tasks. Furthermore, we find that the relative performance of a rendering strategy can be effectively estimated based on factors affecting the input sizes of render loops. The best performing rendering strategies are found to be ones which minimize input sizes using techniques such as compile-time optimization and reactive programming models.},

In our paper, we would like to depict the last fifteen years of the changing popularity of web development frameworks by observing the number of newly created repositories in open-source projects hosted at GitHub that were based on them as well as the number of questions posted on Stack Overflow regarding the respective frameworks. We analyze the correspondence between these two indicators and put them in the context of the popularity of the programming languages that the respective frameworks are based on, as measured by the TIOBE Programming Community index, in an effort to check whether one source could be used to forecast another.},

	url = {https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202405263797},
	abstract = {The rise of JavaScript meta-frameworks has transformed the development of web applications in recent years. Alongside established frameworks, such as Next.js, more recent entrants, such as Astro and Qwik City have introduced novel approaches centred on simplifying developer experience and improving the perceived performance of applications for users. The competitive nature of the meta-framework space and the long-term impact of framework choice on projects calls for an understanding of the factors that drive framework adoption.

This research first delineates extensibility, ease of migration and updates as a set of adoption factors based on prior research and their relevance to modern metaframeworks. The factors form a basis of evaluating three meta-frameworks—Next.js, Astro, and Qwik City—selected based on their popularity, design, and phase on the innovation curve. A developer survey is conducted to complement the analysis, gathering insights from developers on the value they associate with architectural aspects and their personal experiences with the selected frameworks.

The findings substantiate previous research that identified learnability and extensibility as primary adoption drivers. The main risks driving unadoption involve complexity associated with a high degree of configurability and the perceived framework lock-in due to an abundance of framework-specific concepts. Despite shared authoring experiences across evaluated meta-frameworks, the analysis indicates that newer frameworks are showing potential to considerably enhance user and developer experiences by focusing on a simplified authoring experience, addressing issues related to the transmission of application logic from the server to the client and providing more fine-grained approaches to managing client-side JavaScript.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly developing digital age, websites have become indispensable for interaction, information dissemination and transaction. To improve the performance of web applications, choosing the right rendering technology is critical. Next.js is a framework designed to overcome React's limitations in server-side rendering. This study investigates the effectiveness of Client-side Rendering (CSR), Server-side Rendering (SSR), and Static Site Generation (SSG) on the Next.js-based Filmku website using the loading time method. The study concentrates on page loading speed, complete page rendering speed, and user experience. The authentication page takes 422 ms to complete the CSR process, which is 57.41\% slower than the SSG finish time of 180 ms and 34.88\% slower than SSR, which completes the authentication page in 274 ms. On the Profile page, SSG completes the page rendering process much faster, taking only 524 ms, which is 25.79\% faster than SSR's completion time of 706 ms and even 13.75\% faster than CSR's completion time of 608 ms. The SSG rendering method completed in 1,135 ms on the main page, which is 15.93\% faster than the CSR completion time of 1,350 ms and 25.57\% faster than the SSR completion time of 1,525 ms. It is evident that SSG has a faster rendering speed compared to the other methods. However, it should be noted that CSR may result in slower initial page load times. SSR can provide stable rendering times, but it can also burden the server as every client request is fully processed on the server.},

Later, during the analysis phase of the study, the researcher splits the recorded data trace into smaller sections, analyzes each section separately by finding a mean or fitting against a specified function, and uses the analysis results in the study. Here, we present the software that allows to analyze these data traces in a manner that ensures repeatability of the analysis and simplifies the application of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles in such studies. At the same time, it simplifies the routine data analysis pipeline and gives access to a fast overview of the analysis results. For that, the software supports reading the raw data, processing the data as specified in the protocol, and storing all intermediate results in the laboratory database. The software can be extended by study- or hardware-specific modules to provide the required data import and analysis facilities. To simplify the development of the data entry web interfaces, that can be used to enter data describing the experiments, we released a web framework with an example implementation of such a site. The software is covered by open-source license and is available through several online channels.},

              Motivation
              Recombination is an essential driver of virus evolution and adaption, giving rise to new chimeric viruses, structural variants, sub-genomic RNAs and defective RNAs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of virus samples, either from experimental or clinical settings, has revealed a complex distribution of recombination events that contributes to intrahost diversity. We and others have previously developed alignment tools to discover and map these diverse recombination events in NGS data. However, there is no standard for data visualization to contextualize events of interest, and downstream analysis often requires bespoke coding.
            
            
              Results
              We present ViReMaShiny, a web-based application built using the R Shiny framework to allow interactive exploration and point-and-click visualization of viral recombination data provided in BED format generated by computational pipelines such as ViReMa (Viral-Recombination-Mapper).

The effect of this rhythm on health has generated increasing interest in discovering genes under circadian control by searching for periodic patterns in transcriptomic time-series experiments. While algorithms for detecting cycling transcripts have advanced, there remains little guidance quantifying the effect of experimental design and analysis choices on cycling detection accuracy. We present TimeTrial, a user-friendly benchmarking framework using both real and synthetic data to investigate cycle detection algorithms’ performance and improve circadian experimental design. Results show that the optimal choice of analysis method depends on the sampling scheme, noise level, and shape of the waveform of interest and provides guidance on the impact of sampling frequency and duration on cycling detection accuracy. The TimeTrial software is freely available for download and may also be accessed through a web interface. By supplying a tool to vary and optimize experimental design considerations, TimeTrial will enhance circadian transcriptomics studies.},

              Background
              The rapid development of omics acquisition techniques has induced the production of a large volume of heterogeneous and multi-level omics datasets, which require specific and sometimes complex analyses to obtain relevant biological information. Here, we present ASTERICS (version 2.5), a publicly available web interface for the analyses of omics datasets.
            
            
              Results
              ASTERICS is designed to make both standard and complex exploratory and integration analysis workflows easily available to biologists and to provide high quality interactive plots. Special care has been taken to provide a comprehensive documentation of the implemented analyses and to guide users toward sound analysis choices regarding some specific omics data. Data and analyses are organized in a comprehensive graphical workflow within ASTERICS workspace to facilitate the understanding of successive data editions and analyses leading to a given result.

              The use of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in molecular biology research and clinical settings has increased significantly over the past decade. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a lack of simple and interactive tools to analyze and explore RNA-seq data. Many established tools require programming or Unix/Bash knowledge to analyze and visualize results. This requirement presents a significant barrier for many researchers to efficiently analyze and present RNA-seq data.

They contribute to almost all aspects of biomedical research, including studying developmental biology, host-parasite relationships, disease progression and drug effects. However, the high-throughput data generations present challenges for many wet experimentalists to analyze and take full advantage of such rich and complex data. Here we present GeneCloudOmics, an easy-to-use web server for high-throughput gene expression analysis that extends the functionality of our previous ABioTrans with several new tools, including protein datasets analysis, and a web interface. GeneCloudOmics allows both microarray and RNA-Seq data analysis with a comprehensive range of data analytics tools in one package that no other current standalone software or web-based tool can do. In total, GeneCloudOmics provides the user access to 23 different data analytical and bioinformatics tasks including reads normalization, scatter plots, linear/non-linear correlations, PCA, clustering (hierarchical, k-means, t-SNE, SOM), differential expression analyses, pathway enrichments, evolutionary analyses, pathological analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) identifications. Furthermore, GeneCloudOmics allows the direct import of gene expression data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. The user can perform all tasks rapidly through an intuitive graphical user interface that overcomes the hassle of coding, installing tools/packages/libraries and dealing with operating systems compatibility and version issues, complications that make data analysis tasks challenging for biologists.

Moreover, STAGEs takes care of Excel gene to date misconversions, ensuring that every gene is considered for pathway analysis. Output data tables and graphs can be exported, and users can easily customize individual graphs using widgets such as sliders, drop-down menus, text boxes and radio buttons.

              Opening and processing gene expression data files in Excel runs into the inadvertent risk of converting gene names to dates. As pathway analysis tools rely on gene symbols to query against pathway databases, the genes that are converted to dates will not be recognized, potentially causing voids in pathway analysis. Molecular pathways related to cell division, exocytosis, cilium assembly, protein ubiquitination and nitric oxide biosynthesis were found to be most affected by Excel auto-conversion. A plausible solution is hence to update these genes and dates to the newly approved gene names as recommended by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), which are resilient to Excel auto-conversion. Herein, we developed a web tool with Streamlit that can convert old gene names and dates back into the new gene names recommended by HGNC. The web app is named Gene Updater, which is open source and can be either hosted locally or at
              https://share.streamlit.io/kuanrongchan/date-to-gene-converter/main/date\_gene\_tool.py
              . Additionally, as Mar-01 and Mar-02 can each be potentially mapped to 2 different gene names, users can assign the date terms to the appropriate gene names within the Gene Updater web tool. This user-friendly web tool ensures that the accuracy and integrity of gene expression data is preserved by minimizing errors in labelling gene names due to Excel auto-conversions.},

              Using embedding methods, compounds with similar properties will be closely located in latent space, and these embedding vectors can be used to find other compounds with similar properties based on the distance between compounds. However, they often require computational resources and programming skills. Here we develop Dr.Emb Appyter, a user‐friendly web‐based chemical compound search platform for drug discovery without any technical barriers. It uses embedding vectors to identify compounds similar to a given query in the embedding space. Dr.Emb Appyter provides various types of embedding methods, such as fingerprinting, SMILES, and transcriptional response‐based methods, and embeds numerous compounds using them. The Faiss‐based search system efficiently finds the closest compounds of query in the library. Additionally, Dr.Emb Appyter offers information on the top compounds; visualizes the results with 3D scatter plots, heatmaps, and UpSet plots; and analyses the results using a drug‐set enrichment analysis.

	abstract = {Background
              Gene-gene co-expression correlations measured by mRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to predict gene annotations based on the co-variance structure within these data. In our prior work, we showed that uniformly aligned RNA-seq co-expression data from thousands of diverse studies is highly predictive of both gene annotations and protein-protein interactions. However, the performance of the predictions varies depending on whether the gene annotations and interactions are cell type and tissue specific or agnostic. Tissue and cell type-specific gene-gene co-expression data can be useful for making more accurate predictions because many genes perform their functions in unique ways in different cellular contexts. However, identifying the optimal tissues and cell types to partition the global gene-gene co-expression matrix is challenging.
            
            
              Results
              Here we introduce and validate an approach called PRediction of gene Insights from Stratified Mammalian gene co-EXPression (PrismEXP) for improved gene annotation predictions based on RNA-seq gene-gene co-expression data. Using uniformly aligned data from ARCHS4, we apply PrismEXP to predict a wide variety of gene annotations including pathway membership, Gene Ontology terms, as well as human and mouse phenotypes. Predictions made with PrismEXP outperform predictions made with the global cross-tissue co-expression correlation matrix approach on all tested domains, and training using one annotation domain can be used to predict annotations in other domains.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                By demonstrating the utility of PrismEXP predictions in multiple use cases we show how PrismEXP can be used to enhance unsupervised machine learning methods to better understand the roles of understudied genes and proteins. To make PrismEXP accessible, it is provided
                via
                a user-friendly web interface, a Python package, and an Appyter. AVAILABILITY. The PrismEXP web-based application, with pre-computed PrismEXP predictions, is available from:

In this respect, this work presents the development of a software platform using the Scrum methodology and the integrated technology of the Internet of Things for monitoring and managing inpatient safety. A modular solution is developed under a hexagonal architecture, using PHP as the backend language through the Laravel framework. A MySQL database was used for the data layer, and Vue.js was used for the user interface. This work implemented an RFID-based nurse call system using Internet of Things (IoT) concepts. The system enables nurses to respond to each inpatient within a given time limit and without the inpatient or a family member having to approach the nursing station. The system also provides reports and indicators that help evaluate the quality of inpatient care and helps to take measures to improve inpatient safety during care. In addition, diet management is integrated to reduce the occurrence of adverse events. A LoRa and Wi-Fi-based IoT network was implemented using a LoRa transceiver and the ESP32 MCU, chosen for its low power consumption, low cost, and wide availability. Bidirectional communication between hardware and software is handled through an MQTT Broker. The system integrates temperature and humidity sensors and smoke sensors, among others.},
